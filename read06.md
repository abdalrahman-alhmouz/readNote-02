 ### Object literal
* the Object literal notation is basically an array of key:value pairs, with a colon separating the keys and values, and a comma after every key:value pair, except for the last, just like a regular array. Values created with anonymous functions are methods of your object. Simple values are   propertys.

 * In plain English, an object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces. Those values can be properties and functions. Here's a snippet of an object literal with one property and one function.

An object literal can also include functions among its members. Those functions can do everything that any function would otherwise do; it just happens to be a member of an object. You define a function as an object member simply by assigning an anonymous function to the key, instead of the usual scalar value.
