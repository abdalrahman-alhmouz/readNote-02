 ### Object literal
* the Object literal notation is basically an array of key:value pairs, with a colon separating the keys and values, and a comma after every key:value pair, except for the last, just like a regular array. Values created with anonymous functions are methods of your object. Simple values are   propertys.

 * In plain English, an object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces. Those values can be properties and functions. Here's a snippet of an object literal with one property and one function. 
  - 
An object literal can also include functions among its members. Those functions can do everything that any function would otherwise do; it just happens to be a member of an object. You define a function as an object member simply by assigning an anonymous function to the key, instead of the usual scalar value.

 ### Document Object Model :
 * The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. ... The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

 - What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
* In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into separate entities. 
 - The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative equation:
