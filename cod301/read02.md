The position of <scri pt> elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load so it afeect the speed and the loading of the DOM content .
In order to use jQuery, you need to  include the  jQuery script before the closing < /body> tag.

Use **. each () method** when you want to get information from a series of elements.

**chaining** the process of placing several methods in the same selector like this EX:

*$( 'l i [i d!="one"] ') . hide() .delay(SOO) . fadeln(1400);*

JQuery **.ready()method** checks that the page is ready for your code to work with it .
