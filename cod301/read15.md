# DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

## Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

## The experience gap widens

 In a study she conducted in 1995, she found that among first-year computer-science students at Carnegie Mellon University, 40% of male respondents passed the advanced-placement computer-science exam, meaning they could skip the introductory-level programming class. None of the first year women achieved the same result. 
 All that beacuse Men were also more familiar with programming languages than women.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

 Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
 Here are five themes that have emerged from those conversations: 

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
2. Diverse companies perform better
3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
5. It’s the right thing to do
