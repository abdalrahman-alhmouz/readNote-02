## What is Java technology and why do I need it?
 * Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

### what is java used for ?
* Java is used as the server-side language for most back-end development projects, including those involving big data and Android development. Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing.

## compiling in java :
* Compiling a Java program means taking the programmer-readable text in your program file (also called source code) and converting it to bytecodes, which are platform-independent instructions for the Java VM.
#### How to Compile and Run your first Java Program?

* The first step is to create a folder, create a Java Class and write a Java Program. When we write a Java program, javac (Java Compiler) translates the java source code to the bytecode i.e. .class file. Bytecode is machine language of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Bytecode is also referred to as the magic code of Java which is the platform-independent.

* Let’s create a simple java program. 

 - Create a java file as HelloWorld.java

* To compile this program type the command shown below on your command prompt and press enter.


#### jaav Documntation :
*To create the API documentation, the captains of Java ran a program called javadoc. The javadoc program took lines like these right out of the PrintStream.java file and used the lines to make the documentation that you see in your web browser.

- Other Java programmers do the same thing. In fact, everyone who writes Java code uses the javadoc program to generate documentation. So everyone’s Java documentation looks like  - everyone else’s Java documentation. When you know how read to the standard API documentation, you know how to read anybody’s homegrown Java docs.

 - And yes, you can use the javadoc program to create your own documentation. When you download the JDK, you get the javadoc program as part of the deal.
