### Hibernate Many to Many :
@manyToMany :is  represents a collection-valued association where any number of entities can be associated with a collection of other entities. In relational database any number of rows of one entity can be referred to any number of rows of another entity.

 * Many-to-many relationships define entities for which both side of the relationship can have multiple references to each other
* In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations

### This World of Ours
 * I will spend the bulk of my disposable income on comic books,
and instead of recycling, I will throw all of my trash into New
Jersey, where it will self-organize into elaborate “Matrix”-like
simulations of the seagull world, simulations that consist solely
of choking-hazard-sized particles and seagull-shaped objects
that are not seagulls and that will not respond to seagull mating rituals by producing new seagull children. This is definitely
a problem, but problem identification is what makes science
fun, and now we know that we need to send SWAT teams into
New Jersey to disarm a trash-based cellular automaton that
threatens the seagull way of life. Similarly, we know that IFC
research should not focus on what would happen if I somehow used seventeen types of labels to describe three types of
variables. Instead, IFC research should focus on what will
happen when I definitely give all my variables The God Label
so that my program compiles and I can return to my loved ones.
[Incidentally, I think that “The God Label” was an important
plot device in the sixth “Dune” novel, but I stopped reading
that series after the fifth book and my seven-hundredth time
reading a speech that started “WHOEVER CONTROLS THE
SPICE CONTROLS THE (SOME THING WHICH IS NOT
THE SPICE).” Also note that if a police officer ever tries to give
you a speeding ticket, do not tell him that you are the Kwisatz
Haderach and You Can See Where No Bene Gesserit Can See
and you cannot see a speeding ticket. This defense will not hold
up in court, and the only “spice” that you will find in prison is
made of mouthwash and fermented oranges.]
