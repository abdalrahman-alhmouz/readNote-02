* Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.

Important Terms:

 * Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
BST Basic Operations:

 * Insert − Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.
Search − Searches an element in a tree.
Preorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.
Inorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.
Postorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
