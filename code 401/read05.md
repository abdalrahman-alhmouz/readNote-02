## Linked Lists:
 * A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other .
 
 ##### types of Linked List : 
 ![type](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*AeMDLFUjR0w0J4n8CP4H6g.jpeg)
 
 1 - Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has .

 2 - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node.
 
 * Parts of a linked list
A linked list can be small or huge, but no matter the size, the parts that make it up are actually fairly simple. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.
The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node, which is referred to as the head. Nearly all linked lists must have a head, because this is effectively the only entry point to the list and all of its elements, and without it, you wouldn’t know where to start! The end of the list isn’t a node, but rather a node that points to null, or an empty value

  * notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. 
  
  *  tells you the complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its inputs. This is essential if you want to know how algorithms will scale. ... Essentially, Big-O gives you a high-level sense of which algorithms are fast, which are slow, and what the tradeoffs are.
