#### Decimals :
* Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:
 - The position just to the left of the point is the "Ones" position. If we see a "7" there we know it means 7 ones.

 - Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller
