* What are interfaces for Java?
 - An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. , that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
