  * This article called "The code I'm still ashamed of" by Bill Sourour was about his experience of writting code for pharmaceutical company that was selling a particular drug. He didn't think much about the quiz he had made for that company that pushed a certian drug to young women and girls, until the drug caused a suicide, and he found out that the drug caused severe depression. He somewhat blames himself for helping to promote that drug because he helped to build the website that promoted it, and wishes he had never taken part in building that website. I can understand why the author of this article would feel a bit responsible for the suicides from the drug becuase he helped to promote it with the website he built, but at the same time I don't think he should blame himself so much because he wasn't the one who made the drug or was in charge of promoting it. He didn't know anything about the drug, and should of looked into what he was helping to advertise before creating the quiz, but he was just starting out working there, and had to code what he was asked to code. I do agree with the author about the fact that when it comes to coding its best to follow the code of ethics, and to only make code that is beneficial to people, and does not advertise things that are potentially harmful to others. I would make sure to look into what I am coding before I code it, and make sure whatever it is I am helping to advertise will not cause harm to others. 


  * This article is called "Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
", and it was written by Todd Spangler. This article is about the ethics of self driving cars, and how we should deal with the many issues that self driving cars can cause in a no win situations, such as in a potentional car accident where a desion must be made by the self driving car, since the human in the car can't react fast enough to regain control of the vehicle. Since this technology has not been perfected yet and still needs a lot of improvement, I don't think its a good idea to have cars that are totally self driving yet. There are many things that can go very wrong with self driving cars, and I'm not comfortable with the idea a computer deciding who lives and who dies in a car crash. Someday this technology will help to prevent car accidents, and make the roads a bit safer, but until the technology has become better equipt to deal with such situations I think its best to not have the technology become main stream yet. I wouldn't trust a totally self driven car to drive me around yet, since a self driving car can't predict every situation you might wind up in or know how to deal with it. Even though a computer might react faster than a human in an emergency situation, it might not choose the most eithical answer to the situation or could potentially make the situation worse.
