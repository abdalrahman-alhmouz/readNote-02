## Intro to Serverless
- Cloud computing execution model where cloud porvider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.
- Price is based on the number of executions
- event-driven cloud-based system where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service)
- Serverless is reduced cost
- downside serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs. You can't access them through the usual IP
- For simple applications with few dependencies, Serverless is the winner; for anything more complex, Traditional Architecture is the winner.
- serverless app: A Serverless solution consists of a web server, Lambda functions (FaaS), security token service (STS), user authentication and database.

## GraphQL
- The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your applicationâ€™s data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.

- Object types that are annotated with `@model` are top-level entities in the generated API. Objects annotated with `@model` are stored in Amazon DynamoDB and are capable of being protected via `@auth`, related to other objects via `@connection`, and streamed into Amazon Elasticsearch via `@searchable`. You may also apply the `@versioned` directive to instantly add a version field and conflict detection to a model type.
