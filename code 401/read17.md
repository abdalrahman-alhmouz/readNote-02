### Spring Boot and OAuth2 :


* What is OAuth 2.0 and how it works?
* OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean.

It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.
* OAuth, which stands for “Open Authorization,” allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

* All of the sample apps can be easily extended and re-configured for more specific use cases, usually with nothing more than a configuration file change. Remember if you use versions of the samples in your own servers to register with GitHub (or similar) and get client credentials for your own host addresses. And remember not to put those credentials in source control!
