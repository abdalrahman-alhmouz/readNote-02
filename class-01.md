*HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
 - The <HTML> is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format.

- Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important part in an HTML Document.
 - HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, 
 - that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph,
 - one must use the paragraph tags(<p> </p>) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(<img />).

  ##  ### layot :
 *CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
 - This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
- normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. 
- You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. 
- You can also float elements using the float property.
 - To indicate where a box should be positioned, 
- you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

 ### Design Process
 *A structured design process helps me to take up any sort of problem, make sense of it and come up with solutions. 
 
 #### java script 
 *Being a scripting language, JavaScript cannot run on its own. In fact, the browser is responsible for running JavaScript code.
 - When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it is up to the browser to execute it. 
  - The main advantage of JavaScript is that all modern web browsers support JavaScript. So, you do not have to worry about whether your site visitor uses Internet Explorer, .
  - .Google Chrome, Firefox or any other browser. JavaScript will be supported. Also, JavaScript runs on any operating system including Windows, Linux or Mac. Thus, 
  - JavaScript overcomes the main disadvantages of VBScript (Now deprecated) which is limited to just IE and Windows.
