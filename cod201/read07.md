 ### Functions, Methods, and Objects .
 * object 
  - A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. ... This allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object. A method in Java programming sets the behavior of a class object.
  * methods :
   - methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions. An object method is an object property containing a function definition. JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.
 * how do you create objects?
 - Creating an Object
Declaration − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.
Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.
Initialization − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.
