   ### Debugging :
   * The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code. Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu
