## What Is The Chart??

*Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.*

# Canvas Examples
> A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.

*The markup looks like this:*

`<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>`

Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.
